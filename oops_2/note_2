(1) What is Inheritance ?

Ans:-- Inheritance is one of the key features of Object-oriented programming in C++. It allows us to create a new class (derived class) from an existing class (base class).

Why use inheritance :-
1) Code Reusability.
2) Improve Readability.



(2) Polymorphism :---

Ans:-- Polymorphism in C++ allows a single function, operator, or object to behave differently based on the context. It is one of the core principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) and exists in two forms:

1) Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism):
Achieved using function overloading and operator overloading.

2) Run-Time Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism):
Achieved using virtual functions and inheritance.

constructor overloading is the example of Polymorphism

(3) Function overloading:- is a features in c++ where two or more function can have the same name 
                           but different parameters.
