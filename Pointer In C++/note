What is pointer in CPP.

Special variable that store address of other variables.

Pointers are symbolic representations of addresses. 
They enable programs to simulate call-by-reference as well as to create and manipulate dynamic data structures. 
Iterating over elements in arrays or other data structures is one of the main use of pointers. 

Syntax:

datatype *var_name; 
int *ptr;   // ptr can point to an address which holds int data

Example: How to create Pointer

int a = 10;
int *ptr = & a; //create a pointer

float price  = 123.45;
float *ptr = & price; // create a pointer
