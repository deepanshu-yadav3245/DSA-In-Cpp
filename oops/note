Question 1 :--Why Use Oop:--

Object- Oriented Programming (OOP) is used in  C++ because 
It allow for more organized, reusable, and maintainable code by structuring program around real-world Object

Key benefits of using OOP in C++:
1) code Reusability 
2) Modularity :- Breaking down  program into smaller manageable object 
3) Encapsulation:
4) Abstraction
5) Polymorphism

Question 2 :-- Why we use Getter and Setter in CPP

In CPP you use getter and setter to control access to private member variable of class.
1) Data Protection.
2) Abstraction.
3) Validation.

Question 3 :-- What is Constructor in CPP

A constructor is member function of class which initialize object of class in C++.
Constructor is automatically called when Object(instance of class) is created.
It is special member Function Of the class.

Question 3.1 :-- How constructor are different from a normal member function.
1) A Constructor has same name as the class itself.
2) Constructor don't have return type
3) A constructor is automatically called when an object is created.

Types of constructor.
1) Default:-        Does not take any arguments  it has no parameter.
2) Parameterized :- It is possible to pass argument to constructor. 
3) Copy:-            A copy constructor is member function which initialize an object using another object of the same class.


Question 4:  this Pointer.
this is a special pointer in C++ that points to the current object.

Question 5: Destructor ?
A destructor is a special member function that is called automatically when an object goes out of scope or when we delete the object with the delete expression.

In C++, a destructor has the same name as that of the class, and it does not have a return type.  precedes the identifier to indicate destructor. 

class  Wall {
  public:
    // create a destructor
    ~Wall() {
      // code
    }
};
